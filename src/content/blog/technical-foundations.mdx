A great developer experience starts with solid technical foundations. Let's explore how to implement each core element of a modern DevEx setup.

## Security and Quality Integration

### Automated Security Scanning

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run SAST
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      - name: Dependencies Check
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
```

### Quality Gates

Key implementation areas:
- Unit test coverage thresholds
- Integration test requirements
- Code quality metrics
- Performance benchmarks

## Environment Consistency

### Container-Based Development

```dockerfile
# Example development container
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install
COPY . .
CMD ["pnpm", "dev"]
```

### Configuration Management

- Infrastructure as Code
- Secret management
- Environment variables handling
